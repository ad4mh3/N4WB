# N4WB

> Aiming to build a better web browser for ReactOS

N4WB (Net4 WebBrowser) is an open source webbrowser that uses Chromium. It's built on .NET 4 so as to be compatible with ReactOS.

    Due to .NET 4.5 not being easily installed on ReactOS, N4WB uses an outdated and vulnerable Chromium version.
